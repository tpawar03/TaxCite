## Knowledge Gaps
- **214 isolated node(s):** `taxcite`, `P01 `G-C20#0#0s``, `P02 `G-C05#1#0s``, `P03 `G-X19#1#0``, `P04 `G-X07#3#0s`` (+209 more)
  These have ≤1 connection - possible missing edges or undocumented components. (Counts symbols only; 743 node(s) total have ≤1 connection when file, concept and rationale nodes are included.)
- **11 thin communities (<3 nodes) omitted from report** — run `graphify query` to explore isolated nodes.

## Suggested Questions
_Questions this graph is uniquely positioned to answer:_

- **Why does `Chunk` connect `Chunk` to `caselaw.py`, `test_ecfr.py`, `usc_notes.py`, `ecfr.py`, `index.py`, `TaxCite — Status`, `cli.py`?**
  _High betweenness centrality (0.172) - this node is a cross-community bridge._
- **Why does `Decisions Log` connect `TaxCite — Status` to `T2: Ingest eCFR Title 26`?**
  _High betweenness centrality (0.161) - this node is a cross-community bridge._
- **Why does `eCFR Chunking Decisions` connect `T2: Ingest eCFR Title 26` to `TaxCite — Status`, `ADR-17: Vector Store — Qdrant, Not pgvector`?**
  _High betweenness centrality (0.090) - this node is a cross-community bridge._
- **Are the 32 inferred relationships involving `Hit` (e.g. with `base()` and `chunks()`) actually correct?**
  _`Hit` has 32 INFERRED edges - model-reasoned connections that need verification._
