## Corpus Check
- 236 files · ~13,244,101 words
- Verdict: corpus is large enough that graph structure adds value.
- Unclassified: 11 file(s) not represented in the graph (top: (none) 3, .jsonl 3, .xml 3)

## Summary
- 1399 nodes · 2645 edges · 69 communities (60 shown, 9 thin omitted)
- Extraction: 93% EXTRACTED · 7% INFERRED · 0% AMBIGUOUS · INFERRED: 176 edges (avg confidence: 0.88)
- Token cost: 0 input · 0 output

## Graph Freshness
- Built from commit: `dc316bd9`
- Run `git rev-parse HEAD` and compare to check if the graph is stale.
- Run `graphify update .` after code changes (no API cost).

## Knowledge Gaps
- **199 isolated node(s):** `✅ Checkpoint 1 — after T1–T3`, `✅ Checkpoint 2 — after T4–T6`, `✅ Checkpoint 3 — after T7–T8`, `✅ Checkpoint: Phase A complete`, `T2: Ingest eCFR Title 26 into Postgres + Qdrant` (+194 more)
  These have ≤1 connection - possible missing edges or undocumented components. (Counts symbols only; 656 node(s) total have ≤1 connection when file, concept and rationale nodes are included.)
- **9 thin communities (<3 nodes) omitted from report** — run `graphify query` to explore isolated nodes.

## Suggested Questions
_Questions this graph is uniquely positioned to answer:_

- **Why does `Chunk` connect `caselaw.py` to `index.py`, `test_ecfr.py`, `usc_notes.py`, `TaxCite — Status`, `ecfr.py`, `usc.py`?**
  _High betweenness centrality (0.179) - this node is a cross-community bridge._
- **Why does `Decisions Log` connect `TaxCite — Status` to `T2: Ingest eCFR Title 26`?**
  _High betweenness centrality (0.158) - this node is a cross-community bridge._
- **Why does `eCFR Chunking Decisions` connect `T2: Ingest eCFR Title 26` to `TaxCite — Status`, `ADR-17: Vector Store — Qdrant, Not pgvector`?**
  _High betweenness centrality (0.103) - this node is a cross-community bridge._
- **Are the 3 inferred relationships involving `search()` (e.g. with `retrieve()` and `Answer`) actually correct?**
  _`search()` has 3 INFERRED edges - model-reasoned connections that need verification._
- **What connects `✅ Checkpoint 1 — after T1–T3`, `✅ Checkpoint 2 — after T4–T6`, `✅ Checkpoint 3 — after T7–T8` to the rest of the system?**
  _199 weakly-connected nodes found - possible documentation gaps or missing edges._
- **Should `index.py` be split into smaller, more focused modules?**
  _Cohesion score 0.09672830725462304 - nodes in this community are weakly interconnected._
- **Should `test_irs_pubs.py` be split into smaller, more focused modules?**
  _Cohesion score 0.07152496626180836 - nodes in this community are weakly interconnected._
